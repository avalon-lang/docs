# Documentation for the Avalon programming language

This is the documentation of the Avalon programming language.  
As the documentation is still being written and may contain errors, neither HTML nor PDF
builds are provided at the moment.

But the documentation can be read live at [readthedocs](https://avalon-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

## What is Avalon

Avalon is a programming language that targets hybrid classical-quantum computers. These computers 
contain a classical processor that tells a quantum processor what to do.

Avalon has a syntax similar to that of Python so if you know Python, you should be at ease working with it.  
It is statically typed though hence a bit more strict with compile time errors. But it also features 
type inference so you don't need to provide the type unless necessary.

## Why Avalon

Quantum computing is progressing and it needs tools among which programming languages are going to play 
a vital role. Yes, there exists other programming languages that target hybrid classical-quantum computers 
but I have found them to be lacking in abstractions and many even exposing hardware primitives 
making them unfriendly to the novice developer.

## How is the documentation going

You be the judge. Can you use the language after reading it? Does reading the documentation 
help clarify things? Does the documentation make things even more confusing?

If I were to be the judge, I'd say not bad. I will also admit that it still needs a lot of work.
