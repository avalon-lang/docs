Introduction
============

In this introduction, we introduce Avalon's classical and quantum features.
Using a small example, the user is guided through the use classical and quantum
computing features of the language.

.. note::
    
    Use Phil's algorithm here. Basically, we introduce superposition and entanglement
    and show how they are created and used in Avalon.
